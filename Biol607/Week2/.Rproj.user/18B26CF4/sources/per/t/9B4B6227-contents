## QQPLOT

libraries

```{r}
library(tydiverse)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(forcats)



```

Set theme for ggplot

```{r}
theme_set(theme_bw(base_size=12))


```

1.  Read data

    ```{r}
    ice <- read_csv("http://biol607.github.io/homework/data/NH_seaice_extent_monthly_1978_2016.csv") %>%
      mutate(Month_Name = factor(Month_Name),
             Month_Name = fct_reorder(Month_Name, Month))
    ```


2.  Boxplot

Make a boxplot showing the variability in sea ice extent every month. IYKYK make it fancy.

    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = ice, mapping = aes( x =Extent,  y = Month_Name,))+
      geom_boxplot(color = 'grey50')+
      geom_point(aes(color = Month_Name), alpha= 0.6, size= 0.7, alpha= 0.5)+
      stat_summary(color = 'darkred', shape = 18 )

    ```
    
3. Ridgelines
Use ggridges to do the same thing. What do you learn that is different than the boxplot?

```{r}
library(ggridges)


```
