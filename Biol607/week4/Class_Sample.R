# 1. What is a population you sample?
#   
# All Published papers in the last 10 years
# that work with total evidence, 
# molecular or morphological phylogenies (Reptiles).
# 
# 2. How do you ensure validity, reliability, 
# and representativeness of a sample from your population?
# 
# I take care about they have DOI, they are registered in Web of sciences.
